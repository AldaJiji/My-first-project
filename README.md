## Currencies 

My Project is about official currencies of some countries in the world.
In this projet I used data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anurag629/currencies 


In this project we will answer the questions:
  1. Which currency is official in the most countries?
  2. How many currencies are single-country or multi-country?
  3. How many countries use special characters or real letters to denote their currencies? and how many countries use the same symbols?
